1. Random tournaments: consider a sport tournament in which n teams
participate. Each team plays one match against each other team. Each such
match ends with one of the two teams winning (there are no draws). Assume
that all teams are equally strong, so each match has a random winner. We say
that a team is the clear winner of the tournament if it won all its n − 1 matches
(this team beats all other teams). What is the probability that the tournament
ends without a clear winner for n = 10?

Answer. 
Probability of winning 9 games in a row = 0,5^9 for one team. It equals to 0,00195. We have ten teams. As all teams are equally probability of winning 9 game in a row for all teams = 0,00195*10. Probability of winning tournament without clear winner = 1-0,0195 ~0,98 or about 98 percent.

2. Consider a black box containing 50 candies of different colors: 35 black
candies, 8 red, 5 orange and 2 blue. When picking a candy from the box, you
can’t feel nor see any difference between the candies so that you are so that
you are drawing them randomly.
(a) Give the probability of getting 20 black candies when picking simultaneously
25 candies from the box.
(b) You draw simultaneously 25 candies from the box, note the results (n0 black
candies, n1 red, etc), and put them back in the box. You repeat the same
experience and note the results again. What is the probability that the two
lists of counts are identical?

Answers.
a. Let’s assume that,  with probability = 1, we took 5 candies of the colors except black. So, we have to pick 20 black candies from 45 candies. Probability of the next black candy = 35/45, next 34/44, next 33/43 or, in common, we have to pick 20 black candies from 35 blacks and 20 black candies from overall 45 candies: C(35,20)/C(45,20)=0,102%
