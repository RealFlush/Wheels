1. Random tournaments: consider a sport tournament in which n teams
participate. Each team plays one match against each other team. Each such
match ends with one of the two teams winning (there are no draws). Assume
that all teams are equally strong, so each match has a random winner. We say
that a team is the clear winner of the tournament if it won all its n âˆ’ 1 matches
(this team beats all other teams). What is the probability that the tournament
ends without a clear winner for n = 10?

Answer. 
Probability of winning 9 games in a row = 0,5^9 for one team. It equals to 0,00195. We have ten teams. As all teams are equally probability of winning 9 game in a row for all teams = 0,00195*10. Probability of winning tournament without clear winner = 1-0,0195 ~0,98 or about 98 percent.
